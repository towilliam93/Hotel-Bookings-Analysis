# Hotel-Bookings-Analysis

A set of Python queries used to analyze a Hotel Bookings dataset. This project is a part of CareerFoundry's Data Analytics Immersive Course.

# Objectives

This project was different from the previous projects as I had to source my own information and conduct my own analysis.

The purpose of this project was to conduct an exploratory visual analyses on a data set using Python and to find connections between variables that may be worth exploring. 

After developing a hypothesis, various analytical approachs were used to test the hypothesis.

The results are then to be published in a Tableau dashboard/storyboard.
